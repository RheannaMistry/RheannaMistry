        My name is Rheanna Mistry. I am originally from Walnut Creek, California, but
        am currently residing in Seattle, Washington, where I am a student studying
        Informatics at the University of Washington. I am really enjoying Informatics
        as it focuses on using and designing information systems from a human perspective.
        This is my first year in the Informatics major, and I will be completing the
        Human-Computer Interaction Track. I will be graduating in June 2016.

        I am looking for an internship for the summer of 2015. I am currently interested
        in data science, business analysis, UX design, and web development, but am open
        to other fields as well.
    </p>

        My hobbies include swimming, playing chess, and playing piano. I also love traveling
        and have been fortunate enough to have visited seven different countries.
