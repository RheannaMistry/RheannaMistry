        I am originally from Walnut Creek, California, but am currently residing in Seattle, Washington, where I am a senior studying Informatics at the University of Washington. Informatics focuses on using and designing information systems from a human perspective. This is my second year in the Informatics major, and I will be completing the Custom Track, which is comprised of topics from Human-Computer Interaction, Information Architecture, Data Science, and Cybersecurity.

        I am looking for a full-time position after I graduate in June 2016. I am currently interested in data science and business analysis, as well as project management. I have experience with SQL, Excel, SharePoint, R, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        My hobbies include swimming, playing chess, and playing piano. I also love traveling and have been fortunate enough to have visited seven different countries.
